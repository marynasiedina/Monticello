              Increasing prosperity in our lives can be accomplished by having
              the right frame of mind. The truth is, our thoughts are very
              powerful. They are capable of influencing every aspect of our
              daily lives, from our physical health to our social behaviors. I’m
              sure you’ve heard the adage, “As you think, so shall you be.” If
              we want to improve our lives, we must first improve our thoughts.
              Harnessing the power of thought in a positive way has the ability
              to create great change in our lives, including our financial
              well-being and prosperity. But how? How do we take something as
              intangible as thoughts, and manifest them into a physical reality?
              We must first understand that being prosperous is more than having
              a lot of money. Prosperity is a mindset, a way of interacting in
              our lives, and a way of thinking. Mastering this train of thought
              is not easy, but it is simple enough if we keep working on it
              consistently. Following are some ideas to help you improve your
              thoughts, and ultimately attract more prosperity into your life:
              Be grateful for the blessings in your life right now. Take a few
              minutes each day to express heartfelt gratitude for the good
              things in your life. Even more powerful, write a few of these
              blessings down each day. This helps to put your focus in the right
              direction — on abundance, not lack. Use positive affirmations to
              begin training yourself to think positively. Use “I am” statements
              such as “I am worthy of all that is good.” Write the statements
              down and repeat them nightly before bed. Over time, this will
              implant these thoughts into your subconscious mind, and you will
              begin to naturally believe them. Creative visualization can help
              you achieve prosperity by determining what it is you wish to
              achieve, and then thoroughly creating that image in your mind.
              This works in the same way affirmations do. Our subconscious will
              fill with images of prosperity, and eventually these subconscious
              “truths” will manifest in the physical. “See” yourself as being
              prosperous, and you will become so. Encourage yourself with the
              belief that you can achieve great things. This could also be one
              of your affirmations, but expand on it. If you know you can earn a
              certain salary, tell yourself you can earn more. Allow yourself to
              believe all things are possible, and you will gain the confidence
              needed to reach higher than you ever imagined you could. If you
              believe you can do it, you are more likely to take the risks
              associated with people who are highly successful. Prosperity and
              success go hand in hand, so take risks and aim higher. Start a
              savings account. As strange as it sounds, think about this: Like
              Attracts Like. Even if you can only afford to put a few dollars
              into your account every month, it will begin to build up and
              attract more money. Finally, believe you are already wealthy. The
              creative ability of our thoughts is such that we lend more power
              and energy to whatever we consistently focus on. Focusing on lack
              will create more lack. Focusing on wealth and prosperity will
              create . . . guess what? Remember that this is a process. You
              likely won’t change your circumstances in one day. But over time,
              with consistent focus, your thoughts will begin to attract what
              you want. Once you master this power of thought, there are truly
              no limits to what you can create!

              Successful businesses have many things in common, today we’ll look
              at the big ‘R’ of recognition and how a digital advertising
              network may help. Recognition can be illustrated by two
              individuals entering a crowded room at a party. Both walk to the
              far side of the room, one of them slips through the crowd easily
              and unnoticed as they reach the far side. The second person takes
              much longer to reach the far side because they are engaged in
              conversations along the way as they continue to meet acquaintances
              and friends during their path. Which type of person would you like
              to model your business after? Your business is in a continual
              battle for your customers’ recognition whether you know it or not.
              If you happen to be fortunate enough to be in a marketplace with
              very few competitors, that will not last for long. You need your
              business to be at the forefront of your client’s minds so that
              when they require your products or services, you are the go-to
              people. Marketing your business is a necessity. Putting your name
              and logo out there and keeping it there is a must. This lets
              clients know that you are “still around” and in business.
              Frequency is a good way to achieve the “stand out factor” in
              recognition. I am reminded of both television and radio ads I had
              heard of in the past. They run continually with a catch phrase or
              musical jingle over and over again on the radio or television
              until you are absolutely sick of hearing it. You also cannot get
              it out of your head. Although this type of advertising is
              expensive, it can be very effective, and the recognition factor is
              quite high. Television and radio can reach a large audience, and
              they are broad in their appeal. In a brief sentence, you are
              paying to market to both those that are your potential customers
              and a large segment of those who are not now and probably never
              will be your customers. There are more economical ways to pursue
              frequency, the point is to define your target market demographic,
              and invest your marketing funds into the locations that will best
              be seen by them. Another factor to consider is “can I market
              myself in a place where I will stand out from my competition, or
              where my competition does not have a presence?” Why would you
              market yourself in a flyer or newspaper right beside your
              competition and risk blending into a crowd, and ultimately being
              ignored? Another issue to look at is diversification. As the
              saying goes, “don’t put all your eggs in one basket”. When you
              look at your advertising budget for the year, try to find the
              affordable solutions that will continue to reap during the full
              year of your advertising budget. An expensive radio or television
              promotion may give short term gains for that weekend sale, but
              what about the rest of the year? Your clients may end up with the
              impression of where did they go, I haven’t seen or heard anything
              about them for so long. Don’t always look for the old standbys in
              marketing, but keep your eyes and ears open for the latest and
              greatest ways to market your business. With the costs of
              technology coming down dramatically new options such as digital
              advertising on LCD and Plasma screens are becoming more and more
              affordable, and the paper billboards and posters becoming a thing
              of the past. With the flexibility, and curb appeal of full color
              and motion video footage with computer generated graphics
              available to you, this is an option you don’t want to pass by
              without a good look. Ultimately, recognition is required if you
              want to get people “in the door” of your business (or on your
              website for the new e-businesses). This is going to cost you
              money, time and effort up front any way that you look at it, but
              if you have successfully reached your target market, the payoffs
              will be worth it.

              Free directories: directories are perfect for customers that
              are... searching for a particular topic. What’s great about them
              is that you only have to post once and they are good for long
              periods of time. It saves a lot of your time when you don’t have
              to resubmit your information every week or every month. The bad
              news is most of your traffic won’t come from here. I still feel it
              is worth it to get your link out there. Just take one day and set
              it aside for posting to free directories. You won’t need to do it
              again for at least 6 months. 2. Classified Ads: These are great
              for work from home businesses. Think about it. Where do people go
              when they are looking for a job? That’s right-the classifieds. The
              only downside to classified ads is that you have to resubmit them
              quite frequently. Once you find which classifieds bring you the
              most traffic you can concentrate on them and weed the others out.
              So it is really more time consuming in the beginning, and doesn’t
              have to be later on when you get the hang of things. 3. Free
              article submissions/ezines: The best way to inform others about
              your product or service is to write an article about it. In your
              authors resource box, you can tell readers about yourself and
              where they can go to check out your product or service. This is
              also an excellent way to get free links to your site if you have
              one. There are a lot of webmasters out there who are looking for
              good articles they can post on their site. If they post yours,
              that is another site that is doing the advertising for you. All
              for free. 4. URL Submissions: Probably the quickest and easiest
              thing to do to advertise your site. Just type “Free URL
              submission” in your search engine. When you get a list just enter
              the URL you are promoting and click submit. That’s it. It only
              takes a few seconds and your done. Just set a day aside once every
              3 months and do this. 5. Forum Posts: Put your product or service
              website in your signature file when you sign up on some forums. It
              will be displayed every time you make a post. Try to look for
              topics that you have some knowledge on, and can give a relevant
              answer too. Do not spam anyone, you will get kicked off the forum
              and you will get a bad reputation. Get involved asking and
              answering questions that pertain to your area of business. Forums
              are great because once you make a post it stays there forever. It
              will get moved to the archives eventually, but someone could still
              find it if they were searching the archives. Yes, there are many
              people who do. 6. Traffic Exchanges: Probably the most time
              consuming way to advertise for free, but definately the most
              effective. Most forums I have visited have said in many posts that
              they received a lot of their profit from traffic exchanges. If you
              don’t want to spend the time surfing for credits, you do have the
              option of buying them. I would look into a program that lets you
              surf multiple websites at once like crazy browser. There are
              others and they are free to download. That way you can just spend
              one hour a day and get all your surfing in at once. 7.
              News-groups: Become involved in a group that has to do with your
              kind of business. You can usually mail the group once per day, but
              I would encourage you to find something fresh to talk about each
              day. People will tune you out if they see the same message all the
              time. Remember to never Spam anyone. Only join groups with the
              same interests as yours. In other words, don’t sign up for a
              recipe swapping group when you are advertising shaving cream.

              Hypnotize Yourself Into The Ghost. Of Christmas Future
            </h2>
            <p class="article__desc">
              There are many things that are important to catalog design....
              Your images must be sharp and appealing. Your text and even the
              font you use for the text is important. The cover page design and
              the design of your catalog’s product pages all play important
              roles in designing a catalog that will bring in new customers and
              sales. However none of the things mentioned above are more
              important than the type of paper you will choose to print your
              catalog on. The “feel” of your catalog is important to your
              potential customers. The longer they have your catalog in their
              hands, the more product they will buy. In this article I will go
              over some of the many paper choices you have to print your catalog
              on. First you need to decide if the cover will be the same paper
              as the rest of your catalog. In most cases the cover will be of
              heavier weight then the interior pages. Second you will need to
              choose coated or uncoated paper for printing your catalog. Coated
              paper is for the glossier layouts and uncoated is more economical,
              but can still display your products well. So you have two things
              to consider first, “Will it be glossy paper or not?”, “Will my
              cover be the same weight as the interior pages of my catalog?”
              Once you have answered those two questions the next decision is
              what the weight of the paper will be. Most catalogs go with 60,
              70, or 80 lb. weights. So it would be 60lb uncoated or coated, 70
              lb. Coated or uncoated. 80 lb. Paper usually is only chosen for 80
              lb. Weight and above. Also, not all paper is measured by weight.
              Some is measured by thickness or “points”. Now the above is really
              over-simplified. There are other types of special paper you can
              choose from. There is textured paper, photographic paper, and
              other more expensive paper to choose from if you are selling a
              high-end or expensive product. There are also other considerations
              when choosing the paper your catalog will be printed on. Such as
              the method of printing you are going to choose. If you are going
              to have your catalog printed on a hot-set web press, then you can
              choose uncoated or coated paper. The heat will dry the ink as it
              prints your catalog. If your printer uses a cold-set web press
              then the ink air-dries and is absorbed into the paper. A cold-set
              web press cannot print on coated paper. If your printer uses a
              sheet-fed press then you can choose from any of the high quality
              papers they have available. The same goes for printers that do
              digital printing. It will depend a lot on the printer you choose.
              You need to find out what type of paper is available and you will
              want to see samples of the paper to get a better idea of which one
              you want to print your catalog on. Also ask your printer to
              suggest the different types of paper they think will be the best
              for your catalog. Here is a list of some of the types of paper
              your printer may have available for you to choose from or may be
              able to order for you. Dull Coated Paper Matte Coated Paper Glossy
              Coated Paper Antique Paper Vellum Paper Wove Paper Smooth Paper
              Felt Paper Linen Paper Fiber-added Paper Laid Paper Parchment Four
              things determine the quality of the paper, opacity, brightness,
              finish, and ppi. (Pounds per inch) Brightness affects the contrast
              and brilliance of the paper. It affects how your text will stand
              out on the pages of your catalog. Opacity is how much your ink is
              visible from the back of the page. If a paper is too opaque, your
              text and images from one page will be seen through onto another
              page that your customer is trying to read. The finish affects the
              feel of the pages and also how your images will look. The lower
              grade finishes produce grainier images while high quality finishes
              sharpen the look of your images. Ask your printer to provide you
              with samples or swatch booklets and a price list for printing your
              catalog on the various types of paper before you decide. You know
              what your budget is and paper is only one of the expenses you have
              to consider.

              Free directories: directories are perfect for customers that
              are... searching for a particular topic. What’s great about them
              is that you only have to post once and they are good for long
              periods of time. It saves a lot of your time when you don’t have
              to resubmit your information every week or every month. The bad
              news is most of your traffic won’t come from here. I still feel it
              is worth it to get your link out there. Just take one day and set
              it aside for posting to free directories. You won’t need to do it
              again for at least 6 months. 2. Classified Ads: These are great
              for work from home businesses. Think about it. Where do people go
              when they are looking for a job? That’s right-the classifieds. The
              only downside to classified ads is that you have to resubmit them
              quite frequently. Once you find which classifieds bring you the
              most traffic you can concentrate on them and weed the others out.
              So it is really more time consuming in the beginning, and doesn’t
              have to be later on when you get the hang of things. 3. Free
              article submissions/ezines: The best way to inform others about
              your product or service is to write an article about it. In your
              authors resource box, you can tell readers about yourself and
              where they can go to check out your product or service. This is
              also an excellent way to get free links to your site if you have
              one. There are a lot of webmasters out there who are looking for
              good articles they can post on their site. If they post yours,
              that is another site that is doing the advertising for you. All
              for free. 4. URL Submissions: Probably the quickest and easiest
              thing to do to advertise your site. Just type “Free URL
              submission” in your search engine. When you get a list just enter
              the URL you are promoting and click submit. That’s it. It only
              takes a few seconds and your done. Just set a day aside once every
              3 months and do this. 5. Forum Posts: Put your product or service
              website in your signature file when you sign up on some forums. It
              will be displayed every time you make a post. Try to look for
              topics that you have some knowledge on, and can give a relevant
              answer too. Do not spam anyone, you will get kicked off the forum
              and you will get a bad reputation. Get involved asking and
              answering questions that pertain to your area of business. Forums
              are great because once you make a post it stays there forever. It
              will get moved to the archives eventually, but someone could still
              find it if they were searching the archives. Yes, there are many
              people who do. 6. Traffic Exchanges: Probably the most time
              consuming way to advertise for free, but definately the most
              effective. Most forums I have visited have said in many posts that
              they received a lot of their profit from traffic exchanges. If you
              don’t want to spend the time surfing for credits, you do have the
              option of buying them. I would look into a program that lets you
              surf multiple websites at once like crazy browser. There are
              others and they are free to download. That way you can just spend
              one hour a day and get all your surfing in at once. 7.
              News-groups: Become involved in a group that has to do with your
              kind of business. You can usually mail the group once per day, but
              I would encourage you to find something fresh to talk about each
              day. People will tune you out if they see the same message all the
              time. Remember to never Spam anyone. Only join groups with the
              same interests as yours. In other words, don’t sign up for a
              recipe swapping group when you are advertising shaving cream.

              things determine the quality of the paper, opacity, brightness,
              finish, and ppi. (Pounds per inch) Brightness affects the contrast
              and brilliance of the paper. It affects how your text will stand
              out on the pages of your catalog. Opacity is how much your ink is
              visible from the back of the page. If a paper is too opaque, your
              text and images from one page will be seen through onto another
              page that your customer is trying to read. The finish affects the
              feel of the pages and also how your images will look. The lower
              grade finishes produce grainier images while high quality finishes
              sharpen the look of your images. Ask your printer to provide you
              with samples or swatch booklets and a price list for printing your
              catalog on the various types of paper before you decide. You know
              what your budget is and paper is only one of the expenses you have
              to consider.
